# MLPS

Investors who enjoy the tax benefits of limited partnerships but would also like to have the liquidity of publicly traded securities at their disposal can have it all by investing in master limited partnerships (MLPs). However, what are the best MLP stocks to buy?

MLPs issue units that are publicly traded on security exchanges like stocks. MLPs have two types of partners – general partners, who are the company’s owners and manage the daily operations of the partnership, and limited partners, who provide the capital for a partnership’s operation by buying partnership units.

In addition to potential capital growth on the money that is invested, limited partners also receive distributions, which are equivalent to the dividends that are paid by a C corporation.


To identify the best MLP stocks to buy, let’s focus on evaluating MLPs from an extended horizon viewpoint. Under that criterion, we will define the best MLP stocks to buy as those with high dividend yields and long records of rising annual or quarterly distributions.

Investors who are interested in doing their own research to find MLPs that better fit their own investment portfolio strategy can find a complete MLP Directory with filter and sort capabilities on DividendInvestor.com. The following seven MLPs were chosen based on the highest distribution yields and their record of consecutive distribution hikes. All the entries on this list – which happen to be from the Energy sector – yield more than 6% and have hiked their total annual distributions for at least four consecutive years.
